# (B)reeding (I)nsight (G)enomics app <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60955106-fa99-4495-9c8a-c6a7d0b5ed48" align="right" width="250"/>

Currently, Breeding Insight provides bioinformatic processing support for our external collaborators. This ÃŸR shiny app will provide a web-based user friendly way for our internal and external collaborators to analyze genomic data without needing to use command-line tools.

### Supported Analyses

Initial supported analyses will include the mature genomics/bioinformatics pipelines developed within Breeding Insight, with additional analyses continuing to be added.

Supported:
- Genotype processing
  - Dosage call from read counts
  - SNP filtering
  - Sample filtering
- Summary metrics
  - SNP Allele Frequency
  - SNP Minor Allele Frequency
  - Sample Observed Heterozygosity
- Population Structure
  - PCA
  - DAPC
- GWAS
- GS
  - Estimate Model Prediction Accuracy
  - Predict Trait Values for New Genotypes

### Running the BIG app

**Local computer**
1. Install R
2. Open Terminal (on mac)
3. To install and run development version of package:
(in terminal)
```
install.packages("devtools") #If not already installed
devtools::install_github("Breeding-Insight/BIGapp", ref = "development")
BIGapp::run_app()
```
4. View shiny app in browser

**Online (in progress)**
