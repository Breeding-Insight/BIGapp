BIGapp is a user-friendly web application built with R and Shiny, designed to simplify the processing of low to mid-density genotyping data for both diploid and polyploid species. It provides a powerful and intuitive interface for researchers and breeders to analyze genomic data without requiring command-line expertise.

## Key Features

- **Web-Based Interface:** Access BIGapp through your web browser, eliminating the need for complex software installations.
- **Genotype Processing:**
    -  Call genotypes from read counts.
    -  Filter SNPs based on various criteria.
    -  Filter samples to ensure data quality.
- **Summary Statistics:**
    -  Calculate SNP Polymorphism Information Content (PIC).
    -  Determine SNP Minor Allele Frequency (MAF).
    -  Compute Sample Observed Heterozygosity.
- **Population Structure Analysis:**
    -  Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
    -  Conduct Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC).
- **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):**
    -  Utilize GWASpoly for robust association mapping.
- **Genomic Selection (GS):**
    -  Estimate model prediction accuracy.
    -  Predict phenotypic values and Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) for your samples.
- **Expanding Functionality:** BIGapp is actively developed, with new analyses and features continuously being added.

2. **Open Terminal (macOS/Linux) or R Console (Windows).**
3. **Install and Run:**
    ```R
    if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")
        install.packages("remotes")
    
    BiocManager::install("Breeding-Insight/BIGapp", dependencies = TRUE)
    BIGapp::run_app()
    ```
4. **Access in Browser:** The BIGapp interface will open in your default web browser.

### Online Deployment (Coming Soon)
