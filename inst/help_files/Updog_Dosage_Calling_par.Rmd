About Population Models:
Model: What form should the prior (genotype distribution) take?
The following information is from the Updog manual:
Possible values of the genotype distribution (values of model) are: 
`norm` A distribution whose genotype frequencies are proportional to the density value of a normal with some mean and some standard deviation. Unlike the `bb` and `hw` options, this will allow for distributions both more and less dispersed than a binomial. This seems to be the  most robust to violations in modeling assumptions, and so is the default. This prior class was developed in Gerard and Ferrao (2020). `hw` A binomial distribution that results from assuming that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). This actually does pretty well even when there are minor to moderate deviations from HWE. Though it does not perform as well as the `norm` option when there are severe deviations from HWE. `bb` A beta-binomial distribution. This is an overdispersed version of `hw` and can be derived from a special case of the Balding-Nichols model. `s1` This prior assumes the individuals are all full-siblings resulting from one generation of selfing. I.e. there is only one parent. This model assumes a particular type of meiotic behavior: polysomic inheritance with bivalent, non-preferential pairing.
`f1` This prior assumes the individuals are all full-siblings resulting from one generation of a bi-parental cross. This model assumes a particular type of meiotic behavior: polysomic inheritance with bivalent, non-preferential pairing. `f1pp` This prior allows for double reduction and preferential pairing in an F1 population of tretraploids. `s1pp` This prior allows for double reduction and preferential pairing in an S1 population of tretraploids.  `flex` Generically any categorical distribution. Theoretically, this works well if you have a lot of individuals. In practice, it seems to be much less robust to violations in modeling assumptions.`uniform` A discrete uniform distribution. This should never be used in practice.",
