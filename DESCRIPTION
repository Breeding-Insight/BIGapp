Description: This R shiny app provides a web-based user friendly way for researchers to analyze genomic data without needing to use command-line tools.
             Initial supported analyses will include the mature genomics/bioinformatics pipelines developed 
             within Breeding Insight, with additional analyses continuing to be added. Both diploid and polyploid species are supported.
